- Enum gives us predefined set of values that we can choose from 
- Example: day of the week, Month of the year
- E-commere store: xs - xl, colors
- types of accounts: basic plan or premium plan
- used in databases for predefined values
- enum tab tab


1. Arrays
    - their good on memory
    - explicitly what the size is
    - cons: sometimes we just dont know the size
2. Collections
    - More flexible way to work with groups of objects
    - Grow and shrink dynamically as needed
    - key/value pairs (dictionary, hastable)
    - can contain mish mash of data types (non-generic ) (slower)
        -- collections came out in c# 1
        -- generic came out in c#2
            -- generic means all the same data types
    - can contains all the same tdata type (generic) (faster)

```
List<string> myData = new List<string>;

myData.Add("Jin");
myData.Add("Jin");
myData.Add("Jin");
myData.Add("Jin");

forEach (string item in myData)
{
    Cw(name);
}

```

Collection initializer

//collection initializer
```
List<int> numbers = new List<int>{1,2,3,4,5,6};

numbers.Remove(15); // to remove the index in the list

indexOf works and contains works
```
