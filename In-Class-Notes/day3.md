- Dont do the throw if you want program to continue

File manipulation
- when modify and edit a file
- create a file
- deleting a file
- form oof data persistence

Read from csv file
- parse and manipulate it

SystemIO
- I: input
- O: output
- libary
bin/debug/app/text

- stream is like channel or pipeline of bytes
    - like river

- water a to b
- stream is an object
- has method properties and variables

- streams are in one direction
    - its either input or output

- stream to input data and to read the data


file stream you can use stream reader or streamwriter.

0(1) - constant x
0(log n) logrithic time /dividing by constant factorx  y
o(n)- linearx
o(n^2)-nested for loop
o(2n)- information that comes in 2 is constant
o(n3)
o(n logn)-sorting
o(n!) - 5,4,3,2,1
    - permutation, time 
    - con
space
    - [1,2,3,4,5,6] L=6 n
    - log n
    worst case scenario

omega - best - don't worry to much stee slop
theta 0 - average - efficiency randomly picking one of the iteration
    - random iteration 
- 
big o - worst
        - rate of growth
        - trillions
        - 


space
- memory
- method A bring in array
- On - O  
- O1 - 
- space is still growing
- O(1)
- Oh - number of frame
- On^2 

Recurssion binary sorting algorithm
