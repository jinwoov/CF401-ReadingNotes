Interface
tell what class can do
inheritance tell us what a class has
Implement interfaces
inherit from classes

interface

- C# does not support multiple lines of inheritance
- you cannot have both cat and dog inherit to one class
- Class can implement **infinite** of interfaces
- **inherit** from 1 class
- Code by contract
- interfaces in c# idiomatically i infront of the method


ie 
```
iCat
---
can meow
play 
attack
```
they all have to be implemented.
if they are not implemented in the class, it will give error.
- c#8 - default behavior can implement behavior
- should be used more than once

- interfaces require another developer to implement those methods must. What you do with is not importnat repository design pattern
