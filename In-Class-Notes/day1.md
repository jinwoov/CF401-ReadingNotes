- C# has types and it is present 
- it can be 3 different types
    numeric: bytes, short, int, long
    Signed/Unsigned Types: it is numeric interger
    want to allocate and you can use `sbyte` : -128 to +127
    ushort can be 0 to 64,000;
- for querying `var` is good idea but once you know what type it is then it is better to define the type
- char 2 (16bits) charvalue you can compare to numeric value
- to have precision you hvae to put `f` after the number 
- double is by default and it it will be double 
- for financial transaciton that you will probably use `m` = decimal
- boolean is true or false (0/1)
- truncated, it will be cut off at its precision.
- therac-25 is computer radiation machine
- version 3 which patients were given massive radiation than getting 100 times more than the normal radiation doses. 
- putting `throw` can shut off the program.
- finally are like house keeper and they clean up all of the extra stuff before the method is left.
