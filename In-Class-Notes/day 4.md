classes and 

classes: 
class based language
oop
- object oriented means and functional programming languages
- mimics real world objects in code
- c# comes from the class
- we instantiate something
- when you are instantiating, you are creating a object from the class
- class is a template
    - this template is a shell of the object constructor
    - blue print of a categroy or object.
- Object is isntance of class 

- CONSTRCTOR IS prereq info required for an object to get instantiated from the class 

- can be have more than 1 ctor
- compiler gives you 
`ctor` is different from class 

- calling the class without any argument then it will call built in constructor 

- all data types are eiher value and referece types
    - stack is ike call stack
- value is stack
    - int, floats, doubles
    - clones the variable adn gives it a new name
    - if you make a copy of paer than you have two paper
        - if one paper is changed, then the y doesn't change
Has an address to the object but not the boject itself
Referece type only have address

- Heap is big pile of laundry and looking specific socks 
    - socks being blue, and when you are looking for specific socks
- Person amanda = new person
- it points to the reference where the object lives
- Heap is dyanamic memory allocation
- heap is depending the virtual memory
- there is no dependency 
- grab whatever you want
- like the screen share every one can reference
