# Graph

- collection of vertices (nodes)
- they are partially connected by segments name edges
- Vertex is a node that can have 0 or more adjacent vertices
- Edge is connection is between two nodes
- Neighbor is a node that is adjacent nodes
- Degree of vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- `Undirected Graph` is a graph whre each connection is undeirected or bi directional.
- `Directional graph` is where every edge is directed.
- `Complete graph ` is when all nodes are connected. 
- `Connected graph` is a graph that has all edge have at least one edge.
- `Disconnected` when graph for some vertices is not connected
- `Acyclic` graph is without cycle
- `Cycle` graph is where node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
- `Cyclic graph` is a graph that has cycle
- `adjacent matrix is two dimensional array that shows what is connected and to show 1 is placed in the two d position and 0 for not connected edge
- Sparse graph is few connection and dense graph is when there are many connection
- The number with edges and that number is call weight.
- The weights are shown as number in two d array and 0 is represented for edge that is not connected.
- Queue and dequeue is used to traverse and `breadth-first` is a method of traversal.
- `Depth first`is another method to traversal.
