# Humanizing Peer Review

Through this reading, I learned that you can avoid most of the error by doing a code review with peer. Having the second pair of eyes help to catch the bug before the final release. However, few things has be taken into a consideration, such as disparity between quality and experience between author and reviewer can cause offset in review. Also, reviewer or author can learn from how each person wrote the code or review the code. This further expand on knowledge and share new way of writing a efficient code.
