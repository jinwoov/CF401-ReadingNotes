# Peer review

Through this reading, I learned that you can avoid most of the error by doing a code review with peer. Having the second pair of eyes help to catch the bug before the final release. However, few things has be taken into a consideration, such as disparity between quality and experience between author and reviewer can cause offset in review. Also, reviewer or author can learn from how each person wrote the code or review the code. This further expand on knowledge and share new way of writing a efficient code.

1. For peer review I will be reviewing `Custom Claims based policy`. The claim is essential part of our application as we want to bring and design our website catering our user experience. 

2. Code is definitely readable and able to understand what my partner is trying to do and what he wants to capture.The input field is able to carry all the information to the controller and store it in the database.
 
3. The code that I am reviewing is is registration cshtml.cs and it is using the inputs that user have filled out to added into the identity claim. Some of the custom claims are created to cater the user experience later on.

The input is from the cshtml page where user fill out during their registration process. I think he wanted to capture it at this time since getting a user to fill out later would be more challenging. As an output, our plan is to design the product to the favorite color or the design that they like to show up first.

4. There is no bug with this code and the database is able to store these information correctly. When run through I was able to see the claims in the database. 

5. I like that this implementation is outlook for the future usage and able to use this claim info from the user anytime in our website. It is very upfront and explicit.

6. I think for the implementation of the claim capture, if it was me, I would have dropdown lists of choice for the user to choose, so they are able to pick favorite colors, and design that are premade so we can tailor it more easily for our usage.
