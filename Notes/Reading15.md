# DB Seeding and Tag Helpers

- Data seeding is the process of populating a database with inital set of data
- The limitation to model seed data is that data should be already in the database and it needs to be generated without connecting to the database. 
    - The primary key value needs to be specified even if its usually generated automatically
- data seeding is good for testing data
- data needs key values to be generated by the database.
- data that requires calls to exteranl API
- some of the calls can be made to manually migrate the data by using `InsertData()`, `UpdateData()`, and `DeleteData()`. 
- The initialization of logic of data seeding isto use DbContext.SaveChanges() before the main application logic begins execution
